This repository contains a fun letter I wrote to the [Jupiter Broadcasting](https://jupiterbroadcasting.com) team! Because I was not content on using a simple text / office editor, I decided to use [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and adapt a very nice template called [PrettyPDF](https://github.com/nrennie/PrettyPDF) created by Nicola Rennie based on her excellent [tutorial](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/making-pretty-pdf-quarto/).
